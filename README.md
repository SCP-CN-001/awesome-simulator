A curated list of free and open-source simulators for robotics and autonomous driving research. 

This repository aims to highlight simulators that are truly practical and valuable for researchers, following the philosophy that "Awesome is awesome", only the most recommended tools are featured in the Awesome Simulators section. 

At the same time, we recognize and respect the efforts of developers working on emerging or less mature simulators. Therefore, additional sections are included to catalog all known simulators in this domain.
